now (6/1/2014, 2:45am):
 - projects are modeled, displayed via template
 - show/hide implemented



next steps:

allow addition of projects
 - user can add a project
 - it persists in this session
 - user can submit project to moderator
 - user can edit project
 - edits persist
 - user submits project to moderator
 - user must give email!  to authenticate future edit/delete requests

 + add tags to project data

 - create multiple values for members, resources, media fields
   - based on tags



allow editing of projects (belonging to user)

allow searching of projects
 - filters (key, value+count)
 - search bar

create authentication scheme

 + figure out how to create nested objects/arrays in my data model


figure out admin interface
 - simple: add "approved" bool to data model
  - when admin is logged in, he will be shown an option to view unapproved projects
  - each project will have approve/trash buttons in admin view


build server/database
 - try just Node, mongo


CSS! use foundation to prettify site
