							<h3>Vision</h3>
							<p>Our vision is to help the world’s population become the best holistic learners they can be,
							thus creating a happier, more sustainable future for all.</p>

							<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
							<p>
							Developing Real Learners (DRL) is an organisation that seeks to ignite educational 
							transformation that will help young people
							and those involved with them become the best learners they can be.  We aim to help all young people,
							educators and parents shift their primary educational focus towards developing the learner.  
							By developing the learner within a context of good local/global citizenship we hope to
							create learning societies which recognise similarities first and differences 
							as positive learning opportunities, and who care for each other, collaborate,
							and bring a new vision for humanity.

								<h2>What is a Real Learner?</h2>
							</header>

									<p>We define a <strong>real learner</strong> as someone who continuously develops the attributes
									of a great learner independently if necessary and collaboratively if possible all within
									the context of local/global citizenship.</p>  
							
									<p><strong>Real learners</strong> have recognised the human disposition to learn within themselves
									and are set on developing this aspect of their nature with the aim to create better,
									more sustainable, happier and more fulfilling lives for themselves and others.  They 
									recognise also that, by all of us becoming better learners, we increase the chances
									of our sustainable survival.</p>
							
									<p>The development of the learner is ultimately a personal mission &mdash; however, although it can be
									an independent mission one young person follows, it can also be the mission of a group or class or school
									or education system or perhaps even everyone on the planet.  <strong>Wouldn’t the world be a better place if
									we were all the best learners we could be?</strong></p>
							
									<p>For the young individual, becoming a real learner gives purpose to developing
									not just in school but in any activity they wish to or are compelled to explore.</p>
									
									<p>For teachers, it’s about finding the real essence of your profession &mdash; helping young people not just 
									become better students, not just learn how to learn but to be able to develop themselves as learners and
									therefore as people.</p>
									
									<p>This is not a new programme (although it can inspire new programmes).  This is a way of approaching
									teaching and learning which can be utilised in any current education system and aligns with any culture.</p>
							
									<!--p>(this could be a good place to plug the online course, e.g.: "For more information, consider taking
									our free online course. [link]")</p><!-->

								<div class="6u padded" id="attributes">
							
									<p>DRL uses ‘fourteen +’ attributes that allow learners to make the most of their education and experiences 
									throughout their lives. The fourteen are listed here; the ‘+’ is there so that if your educational culture
									finds more, you can add them as long as the concept of the real learner for life is kept intact.
									We believe that <strong>Real Learners</strong> are:
